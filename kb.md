## 4. Product: Veri Rev Ops (Revenue Operations)
* **Concept:** A "CTO-as-a-Service" for Sales Operations. It replaces the "Black Hole" of WhatsApp with a structured Data Pipeline.
* **Architecture:**
    * **Single-Tenant:** Each client gets an isolated container environment. No shared databases.
    * **Zero-Trust Security:** Uses Distroless Docker (banking-grade security, non-root users) to ensure data ownership.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Universal Inbox (Chatwoot):** Aggregates WhatsApp, Telegram, and Email into one unified command center. Ensures client data stays with the company, even if salespeople leave.
    * **Smart Handoff (HITL):** The system detects "Angry" sentiment or complex requests and instantly alerts a human agent to take over.
    * **Native CRM Sync:** Deep integration with EspoCRM & HubSpot. Every chat creates a lead automatically; "New Lead" signals (budget, timeline) update the CRM profile in real-time.
    * **VeriBot (Audio Intelligence):** Unlike standard bots, VeriBot listens to voice notes, understands the context, and responds with a generated audio message. It converses rather than just transcribing.
    * **Multimodal Vision:** The bot can "see" images sent by users (via Gemini Vision) to diagnose problems (e.g., identifying a broken part from a photo).
    * **Self-Correcting Intelligence:** The AI generates an answer, grades it against "Truth Documents" (PDFs), and rewrites it if the grade is low before sending. This ensures zero hallucinations.

## 5. Product: Enterprise Integrations
* **Concept:** Enterprise API Orchestration that connects fragmented software into a unified ecosystem.
* **Technology Stack:**
    * **MuleSoft & ESB:** Used for heavy-duty API Management and connecting legacy systems like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce.
    * **Python:** Used for complex data transformation, web scraping, and AI models that "no-code" tools cannot handle.
    * **n8n:** Low-code automation used for rapid deployment and connecting modern SaaS tools.
    * **Cloud Infrastructure:** Architected on AWS/Azure using Docker containers and serverless scalability.
* **Service Capabilities:**
    * **API Development:** Building secure REST/GraphQL APIs so partners can connect without exposing the core database.
    * **Data Migration:** Handling ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) for companies moving from On-Premise servers to the Cloud.

## 6. Privacy & Data Governance
* **Controller:** Veridata and VeriAcademy.
* **Collected Data:** Phone numbers (WhatsApp ID), profile names, message content, and technical interaction logs.
* **Usage:** Strictly for delivering automated responses and Natural Language Processing (AI). Data is not sold to third parties.
* **Infrastructure:** Data transits through Meta (WhatsApp API), LLM providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google), and Cloud Providers (AWS/Azure/GCP).
* **User Control:** Users can delete their data at any time by sending the command "DELETE DATA".
